This is a program to run a skipbo game. 
To run a new game you can use the following command:
./skipbo <bool shuffle> <int numPlayers> <int stockSize> <deck file>

And if you want to load a saved game you can run the following command:
./skipbo <bool shuffle> <savefile>

The range of possible players is 2-6
If you have 6 players, the maximum stock size is 20, otherwise it is 30. 
You cannot have less than 1 card in the stock.

At the start of your turn, you will be given a choice to (p)lay (s)ave or (q)uit
	p - play will allow you to make moves and carry out your turn.
	s - save will allow you to save the current game into a file that can later be loaded to continue the game. You will be prompted to enter a save file name.
	q - quits the game immediately. No save will be created. 
If you opt to play, you will be prompted to enter a move.
A valid move consists of one of two options, you can either (m)ove and then specify the 
[start] - the card from the hand, discard pile, or stock pile you want to play
[end]  - the  build pile, or discard pile where you want to place the card
Or (d)raw to fill your hand. NOTE: this may only be done on an empty hand.

When a draw pile is full, we store it in an oldBuildPile card vector in the DrawPile object. This way when the draw is empty, we do not need to have another object referenced to fill it.


If you created a game with this run command:

skipbo false 4 30 deck0.txt

The first display would look like this:

Draw: [XX]/42  Build Piles: --/0 --/0 --/0 --/0 
Current Player0:  Stock{0}: [9]/30
   Discards{1-4}: --/0  --/0  --/0  --/0  
   Hand{5-9}: --  --  --  --  --  


And if you saved the state right away, you'd get:
